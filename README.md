# Transformer Implementation in PyTorch

This repository contains a Transformer model built from scratch using PyTorch. The Transformer architecture is widely used in NLP and deep learning tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and more.

Features

Custom Transformer model implemented from scratch

Supports positional encoding, multi-head self-attention, and feed-forward layers

Easily extendable and trainable on any NLP dataset

Implements both encoder and decoder networks

Installation

Prerequisites:requirment.txt


Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed:



Usage

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/PUNEET-KOUNDAL/Transformer-LLM.git
cd Transformer-LLM

2. Run the Model

Execute the script to train or test the Transformer: (right now it have error , but solve soon )

#python train.py  # Example script for training ( error right now )

3. Example Input & Output




print(output.shape)  # Expected shape: (batch_size, seq_length, target_vocab_size)
